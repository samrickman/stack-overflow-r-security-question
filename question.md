# Risks of running code in R questions locally

The common advice here for those asking questions on Stack Overflow is to post [minimal reproducible example][1]. In R this generally differs slightly from other languages, as the expectation is that a small amount of data will be posted with the question to allow the problem to be replicated. Examples picked randomly from the last couple of days are . When a user does not post data, usually a comment requesting they do so will be added (e.g. ).

When answering questions, I will often glance at the code and if it seems OK, merrily copy and paste the code and run it locally.

The problem is that it would be quite easy to obfuscate malicious code.
