# Stack Overflow security

This repo was created so I could upload a payload (`payload.R`) to demonstrate the risk of running apparently innocuous code from a Stack Overflow on a local machine. The payload only prints `I am running remote code`. However, it could be amdended to include anything..

For full details, see the `question.md`, or the actual [Stack Overflow question]().
